   * Problem 1
   * <p>
   * As a flower shop owner, i want to have a program to save my customer purchase.
   * The customer will have a cart to save their order. i want my cart to have
   * print function to show every item in it and it's price, every same product
   * will be grouped and it will show how many item for that. Lastly it also show
   * the total price.
   * <p>
   * Currently i only have 2 type of product: single flower(only 1 flower)
   * and bouquet(up to 5 flower). the price for single flower product type will follow
   * flower price and for bouquet it will be the sum of flower prices on it
   * plus wrapping fee $7
   * <p>
   * I have 5 kind of flower: Rose(price $2), Lily(price $3), Tulip(price $5), Sunflower(price $4),
   * and Daisy(price $1)
   * <p>
   * Example:
   * <p>
   * Customer bought: 2 single Rose, 1 single Sunflower, and 1 bouquet consist of 4 Tulip and 1 Lily.
   * So it should be printing:
   * <blockquote>
   *  {@code single Rose}<p>
   *  {@code $2 x 2               :    $4}<p>
   *  {@code single Sunflower}<p>
   *  {@code $4 x 1               :    $4}<p>
   *  {@code bouquet(4 Tulip, 1 Lily)}<p>
   *  {@code $30 x 1              :   $30}<p>
   *  {@code ____________________________}<p>
   *  {@code TOTAL              :   $38}<p>
   * </blockquote><p>
